From time to time in the years to come,

I hope you will be treated unfailrly so that you will come to know the value of justice.

I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty.

Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time, so that you don`t take friends for granted.

I wish you bad luck again from time to time, so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completetly deserved either.

And when you lose as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then your opponent will gloat over your failure.

It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship.

I hope you`ll be ignored, so you know the importance of listening to others.

And  I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion.

Whether I wish these things or not they`re going to happen, and whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.
