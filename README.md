Aï¼šAlright, everyone looking foward,please.
Aï¼šGood morning Year Elevens.
Aï¼šToday`s assembly is about the start of a journey.
Aï¼šThe start of the rest of your lives.
Aï¼šIn 2 years time all of you will be finishing your A levels.
Aï¼šIn 3 years time you`ll be studying across the world, studing at the university of your choice.
Aï¼šIn 5 years time you`ll have started your careers.
Aï¼šMany of you will be in this room working for the top institutions across the globe.
Aï¼šYou will get married you then may bug a house.
Aï¼šIn 10 years time your life will be set for you.
Aï¼šIn 15 years you`ll be 30 and from then on your path, your life will be set.


Bï¼šI`am sorry Mr.Headermaster.
Bï¼šLet me tell you why that approach may fail you.
Bï¼šI know people who graduated at 21 and didn`t get a job until they were 27.
Bï¼šI know people who graduated late at 25 and they found work immediately.
Bï¼šI know  People who never went to university bug found what they love at 18.
Bï¼šI know people who found a job straight out of college making decent money, but hate what they do.
Bï¼šI know people who took gap years and found their purpose.
Bï¼šI know people who were so sure about what they were going to do at 16, they change their mind at 26.
Bï¼šI know people who have children but are single and I know are married but had to wait 8 to 10 years to have children.
Bï¼šI know people in relationships who love someone else.
Bï¼šI know people who love each other but aren`t together.
Bï¼šSo my point is everything in life happens according to our time, our clock.
Bï¼šYou may look at some of your friends andd think that they`re ahead of you.
Bï¼šMaybe some if them you feel are behind but everything happens at their own pace.
Bï¼šThey have their own time and clock and so do you.
Bï¼šBe patient.
Bï¼šAt age 25, Mark Cuban was a bartender in Dallas.
Bï¼šIt took till 32 for J.K. Rowling to be published for Harry Potter after being rejected by 12 publishers.
Bï¼šOrtega launched Zara when he was 39.
Bï¼šJack Ma started Alibaba when was 35.
Bï¼šMorgan Freeman got his big break at 52.
Bï¼šSteve Carell only got his break after 40 years old.
Bï¼šVirgin was started by Richard Branson at 34.
Bï¼šGetting your degree after 25 is still an achievement.
Bï¼šNot being married at 30 but still happy is beautiful.
Bï¼šStarting family after 35 is still possible and buying a house after 40 is still great.
Bï¼šDon`t let anyone rush you with their timelines.
Bï¼šBecause as Einstein said, "Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that`s counted truly counts"
Bï¼šAnd this is the most inportant thing, I want you to be able to create meaningful, purposeful fullfilling lives for yourselves and learn how to use that to make an impact and a difference in the lives of others.
Bï¼šThat will be true success.
```
